1) Problem Statement: To create a fully functional, two-player game application that demonstrates the practical application of foundational Python programming concepts such as lists, loops,       functions, and conditionals, solving the simple problem of managing turns and checking victory conditions in Tic-Tac-Toe20202020.

2) Scope of the Project: The project is limited to a text-based, command-line interface (CLI) game on a standard $3\times3$ board for two human players. It does not include a GUI, network multiplayer, or an AI opponent21.

3) Target Users: Programming novices or students learning fundamental concepts like loops and conditionals22.

4) High-level Features: Game initialization, move validation, board update, and win/draw condition checking23232323.
